# 3-Body-Decay-Event-Generator
A Mathematica package used to illustrate and explore 3-body kinematics. 

This package will randomly generate 3-body decay events. The ThreeBody function takes as input the mass of parent particle M, and the masses of three daughter particles m1, m2, and m3. The output is a list of three 4-momentum vectors (E, p_x  p_y, p_z) corresponding to the three daughter particles for the randomly chosen decay event. A few examples of how to use this event generator are given.
